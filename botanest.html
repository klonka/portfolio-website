          <h2>Design Approach</h2>
          <p>
            Following the vital stages of the Design Thinking Process, I began this project by understanding the business needs and user goals in order to create the product's core features. Moving forward, I drafted wireframes to gather initial
            feedback and make necessary revisions. As the product matured, I then created high-fidelity wireframes to test the design with potential users. After several rounds of iterations based on the results from testing, the final design was
            polished.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2>Design Challenge</h2>
          <p>
            Plant owners find the process of caring for their plants relaxing and enjoyable; however, they are faced with uncertainty of where to turn hen their plant is not thriving. As a designer, the challenge is to create product in which,
            time-constrained metropolitans seek personalized plant care from a source they can trust.

        <h2>01 | Competitive Analysis</h2>
        <p>
          To get an understanding of the challenges presented with plant apps, two competitors were analyzed. Upon evaluating these two leaders, I noted each respective app’s strengths, weaknesses, threats, and opportunities. Not only did I assess
          both app’s features and functionality, but I also identified each platform’s use of UI, branding, customer feedback, and press releases.
        </p>

    <div>
      <div>
        <h2>02 | User Research</h2>
        <p>
          With the competitor insights in mind, I had a better understanding of the direction I would begin to take my app. To learn from the potential users, I conducted three live interviews with plant owners and two live interviews with plant
          experts. In this case, the ‘experts’ were owners of plant shops in which, I gathered background about the types of customers they have and the frequent questions they encounter. All five interviews uncovered valuable insights into the
          kind
          of behavior, needs, and motivations each interviewee embodies. Using these findings, affinity mapping identified themes and patterns to create actionable steps for pain points, concerns, and needs of the users.

        <h3>Key Learnings</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Google is most often used to gather expert advice — identify plants, disease remedies, and general plant care</li>
          <li>Maintenance outside of watering is not as commonly understood — repotting, fertilizing, and propagating</li>
          <li>Proper sunlight is an issue when it comes to having indoor plants and changing seasons</li>
          <li>Plants look worse when friends or neighbors look after their plants while on holiday</li>
          <li>The more plants one owns, the more likely they can’t remember exact species and specific needs</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div>
      <div>
        <h2>03 | User Personas</h2>
        <p>
          Based on the gathered research, two user personas were created to help establish empathy and make design decisions with the user’s needs and goals in mind. Leo is more experienced with his plant care and is more willing to be adventurous
          with the species chosen; whereas, Daria previously had a negative experience owning plants. Both personas allow to prioritize functionality that is most ideal for users that are likely to experience the app.

    <div>
      <div>
        <h2>04 | User Journey Map</h2>
        <p>
          With the user personas in mind, journey maps were created in order to visualize the processes a user goes through to accomplish a goal on the app. These goals were specific to the respective personas and identified what they would use the
          app for. In the example below, Daria comes to the app to use the plant identification feature. The user journey maps are narrative documents that create a focused, shared vision throughout the design process.

    <div>
      <div>
        <h2>04 | User Journey Flow</h2>
        <p>
          Knowing what Leo and Daria expect out of the app allowed for diagrams of the pages both personas would interact with to complete a task or achieve a goal. The flows, similar to the example below, ensured the overall design is
          user-centered
          and successful in avoiding mistakes upfront with the product.

        <h2>05 | Information Architecture | Card Sorting</h2>
        <p>
          Although I had an understanding of the outline of the app from the user journey maps and flows, an online Hybrid Card Sort was conducted with five participants to evaluate the structure of the app and determine the most logical and
          user-friendly way to organize content. In addition, the participants were asked to complete two questions prior to beginning the test to gauge their level of familiarity with using a website or application for plant care as well as, an
          optional question inquiring about the types of features that would be useful to have in a plant care app.

    <div>
      <div>
        <h3>Key Learnings</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>All participants do not currently use an app for plant care but most of them do use Google or a dedicated website to gather their plant related information</li>
          <li>Desired app features for the participants include: plant identification, plant care instructions, videos, and reminders</li>
          <li>There were no discrepancies with 38% of the cards sorted into the same categories by all participants</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div>
      <div>
        <h2>05 | Information Architecture | Sitemap</h2>
        <p>
          Using the findings from the card sorting helped create this organizational map used to illustrate the hierarchy of the pages and how they connect with one another. Through this visual process, I was able to determine if the content needed
          to be reworked in any way.

        <h2>06 | Wireframes -- Low Fidelity</h2>
        <p>
          In order to highlight the high-level functionality of the web app, several low-fidelity wireframes were created in Balsamiq for mobile and desktop screens based on the findings from the discovery stage. These wireframes focused on the
          core
          structure and navigation a user would require such as, sending a request to a botanical expert, setting reminders for plant care, and adding plants to their profile as shown in the example below.
        </p>

    </div>

    <div>
      <div>
        <h2>06 | Wireframes -- Mid-Fidelity</h2>
        <p>
          A more refined process was implemented with the mid-fidelity wireframes. Regarding the example showing the process of adding a plant to the user’s profile, the search capabilities remained the same, but the structure of the plant profile
          changed slightly. Additionally, the branding began to take shape with the name ‘Botanest’ introduced to these wireframes.
        </p>
        <img src="img/botanest/midfid_add.jpg" alt="Mid Fidelity Wireframe">
        <p>
          In addition to the process of searching for a plant and adding it to the user’s profile, the ability to customize the added plant was introduced. As shown here, the personalization of adding your own plant’s image versus using a stock
          photo or giving it a nickname in lieu of a scientific name allow the user to feel more connected with the process of adding plants to a digital space. Also, these steps help the user set custom reminders that are most valuable to them
          in order to best take care of their houseplants.

        <h2>06 | Wireframes -- High-Fidelity</h2>
        <p>
          Following the mid-fidelity wireframes, all further details of the features to depict how the web app would look, feel, and function were implemented using Sketch. As shown in the below example, the dashboard was completely redesigned,
          the search page included plant suggestions for users to have a look over for inspiration, and the process of customizing the added plant was refined into one scrollable format. Finally, the branding of botanest took shape across the
          logo, names of the features, and the inviting, supportive copy used throughout.

        <h2>07 | Usability Testing -- Plan</h2>
        <p>
          Using the high-fidelity prototypes, six moderated usability tests were conducted via InVision. The aim was to test the core features of the web app for usability and utility to ensure the functions were intuitive as intended. Testing
          at
          this stage allowed for the opportunity to spot any possible issues prior to development. In addition, user feedback contributed to a greater understanding of whether the features and overall web app connected with the users.
        </p>
        <h3>Objectives</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Can our users identify their plant’s species using the Expert function?</li>
          <li>How can the user search for a plant that they want to add to their Nest?</li>
          <li>Will the users know how to share their plant care schedule with a friend?</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Methodology</h3>
        <p>
          In-Person Moderated Tests in the users home or in a quiet café decorated with plants
        </p>
        <h3>Participants</h3>
        <p>
          A total of 6 participants recruited by my personal network or through plant hobbyist Facebook group. All participants live in Berlin where live tests were conducted. Detailed information about the participants and their responses to
          the
          pre-interview/first impressions can be
          <a href="files/participants.pdf" target="_blank">found here</a>
        </p>
        <h3>Script</h3>
        <p>
          Each interview was accompanied by a script outlining an introduction of the app being tested, preliminary demographic, background and open-ended questions, and the tasks each participant was asked to complete. For a detailed view of
          the
          tasks and talking points follow

        <h2>07 | Usability Testing -- Report</h2>
        <p>
          All participants completed each task successfully and navigated through the prototype with minimal difficulty. However, there were some points of feedback and criticism that were noted especially if the same comment was made multiple
          times.
        </p>
        <h3>Rainbow Spreadsheet</h3>
        <p>
          To organize my findings and visually note any patterns, a rainbow spreadsheet was created where I prioritized iterations based on the feedback received. The Rainbow Spreadsheet can be
          <a href="files/results.pdf" target="_blank">found here</a>

        <h4>Summary of Top 3 User Issues & Errors</h4>
        <h4>Severity Rating – High</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Confusion with layout of the dashboard (e.g. button, alerts, plants displayed</li>
          <li>Sharing a plant schedule via the calendar feature was not clear</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Severity Rating – Medium</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Questioned the steps needed to add a plant to profile (i.e. plant care alerts, birthday)</li>

        <img src="img/botanest/iter1.jpg" alt="Iteration">
        <h3>Evidence and Solution</h3>
        <p>
          More than half of those tested questioned why items were pending in the Notifications area and what the overall purpose of the section was
          For these users who questioned the purpose of the Notifications, it was clear they were not correlating the steps they performed in the previous task with the items that were ‘pending’. Providing a clear CTA in the updated
          version eliminates this confusion and draws more attention for the user so they are aware of what they need to do.
          The plants displayed in the user’s profile and the order of urgency were not clear to more than half of those tested The order of the plants shown was revised to indicate the plant that needs urgent attention (‘Bernie’) as
          listed first due to the current alert. Additionally, a description for the Zebra Cactus was included to remind users what this plant’s current status is.
          83% of participants wanted to begin the tasks within the menu icon even after clicking on the ‘+’ button
          In the revised design, the sole function of the ‘+’ button on the home screen can now bring users to a search function to add a plant. In the former design, this button could perform three tasks, but this led to frequent
          hesitation and questions from the participants, especially when there was a hamburger menu with the same functions listed in there as well.

        <p>
          50% of the participants did not click on the ‘share schedule’ button to begin task and several commented that they would not think to enter the calendar feature to share their plant’s schedule
          As a result of the feedback provided and non-verbal communication of the participants, I decided to adjust where the Care Calendar feature was located. Also, the feature to share your plant schedule is now listed in each
          individual plants profile which the user can access from the home screen. It is more intuitive for the users to go directly to the plant they have in mind versus searching for the share function elsewhere.
          The users found it difficult to spot the ‘Share schedule’ button due to how far down the screen it was
          The button to share your plant schedule is at the top of the screen to call attention to this feature in a more prominent location.

        <h3>Evidence and Solution</h3>
        <p>
          There were moments of friction when participants were answering the steps in order to add a plant to their profile. In particular, the most negatively commented section related to addressing ‘plant care alerts’ and ‘birthday’ of
          the plant being added.
          Upon testing, I discovered that some of these questions could be simplified or removed all together. The number of questions asked when customizing your plant has been reduced, and the format of the questions as well as the copy
          now have a more clear description. In the end, only questions that are vital for personalization/reminders remain. Finally, the ability to skip these questions has been implemented for those who wish to not go through with all
          the steps.
          A key challenge of knowing where to put a plant in the user’s flat due to low sunlight was mentioned by every participant; however, no where in the app was this addressed or solved for.
          The revised process now includes callouts for users who need more details about the type of sunlight each plant requires, recommendations of which rooms of their flat are best equipped for the plant species, and allows users to
          customize the sun exposure in their home.
